  <h1>5 Natural Ways to Boost Your Immune System</h1>
  <p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
  Your immune system is your body’s natural defense against illness. Keeping it strong doesn’t always require medication—nature has given us powerful tools to support immunity every day.</p>

  <h2>1. Eat Immune-Boosting Foods</h2>
  <p>Add citrus fruits, garlic, ginger, and spinach to your diet. These foods are rich in <strong>vitamin C</strong>, <strong>antioxidants</strong>, and <strong>anti-inflammatory</strong> compounds.</p>

  <h2>2. Stay Hydrated</h2>
  <p>Drink 8–10 glasses of water daily. Herbal teas like <strong>turmeric</strong>, <strong>chamomile</strong>, or <strong>green tea</strong> also help detoxify your system.</p>

  <h2>3. Prioritize Sleep</h2>
  <p>Aim for <strong>7–9 hours</strong> of quality sleep. Sleep helps your body repair and fight off infections more effectively.</p>

  <h2>4. Reduce Stress Naturally</h2>
  <p>Practice <strong>yoga</strong>, <strong>deep breathing</strong>, or <strong>meditation</strong> for 10–20 minutes a day. High stress weakens immunity by increasing cortisol.</p>

  <h2>5. Get Daily Sunlight</h2>
  <p>15 minutes of sun exposure helps your body make <strong>vitamin D</strong>—essential for immune function. If you don’t get enough sun, consider a <strong>vitamin D supplement</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Small daily habits can lead to big health improvements. Start with one change today and build from there. Your immune system will thank you!</p>
